How we divided the work:
We filmed all together, using equipment that we rented from the equipment center. We recorded the audio with our phones and toomie edited the audio on audacity. After filming we agreed to split the work into audio editing, video editing and making the website among ourselves. Toomie edited and compiled the audio, Dania color corrected the videos and edited the clips, and Jun coded the website. The text from the site was on a shared google doc, and we all contributed to writing that. 

Theme of the site and Interactivity:
We decided to make our website look exactly like WikiHow, since it fits the theme of our ‘How-to’ prompt. The site only shows steps 1&2 at the start, but after the ‘twist’ and the title change (the website also changes color), an alert appears on screen and the user has to click to reveal the final step: Hiding the body
